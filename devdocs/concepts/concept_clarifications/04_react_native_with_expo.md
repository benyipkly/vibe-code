# 04: React Native with Expo

### What it is and why it matters

React Native is a popular open-source framework for building native mobile applications using JavaScript and React. Expo is a framework and a platform for universal React applications, providing a set of tools and services that simplify the development and deployment of React Native apps. This technology choice matters because it allows for rapid development and a single codebase for multiple platforms (even though our initial target is Android).

### How this concept helps the overall project

This technology choice significantly helps the project by:
-   **Accelerating Development:** Expo's tools and pre-built components streamline the development process, allowing the focus to remain on the educational content and simulations.
-   **Leveraging Web Skills:** It allows developers with a background in React and JavaScript to build a high-quality mobile application without needing to learn native Android development (Java/Kotlin).
-   **Simplifying Builds:** The Expo toolchain simplifies the process of building, sharing, and iterating on the application.

### How this concept limits the overall project

The primary limitation is that Expo can be restrictive. While it covers a vast range of common use cases, any vulnerability demonstration that requires deep, custom native code not supported by the Expo SDK would be difficult or impossible to implement without "ejecting" from the managed Expo workflow, which adds significant complexity.

### What kind of information this concept needs as input

This concept requires the project's functional and non-functional requirements to be feasible within the Expo and React Native ecosystems. It also requires developers to have proficiency in JavaScript and the React framework.

### What kind of process this concept should use

The development process will be the standard modern JavaScript workflow:
1.  **Prototyping:** Use React Native components to build the UI for the modules.
2.  **Logic Implementation:** Write the application logic and simulations in JavaScript.
3.  **Dependency Management:** Use a package manager (like npm or Yarn) to handle third-party libraries.
4.  **Testing:** Use the Expo Go app for rapid testing on a physical device without needing a full build.
5.  **Building:** Use the Expo Application Services (EAS) to build the final `.apk` (Android App Bundle) for distribution.

### What kind of information this concept outputs or relays

This concept outputs a fully functional Android application. It takes the JavaScript code, React Native components, and all associated assets and compiles them into a native app that can be installed and run on Android devices.

### Explain the good expected outcome of realizing this concept

The ideal outcome is a polished, performant, and stable Android application developed in a fraction of the time it would take with traditional native development. The app is easy to maintain, and the modular nature of React components aligns perfectly with the "Vulnerability Modules" concept.

### Explain the bad unwanted outcome of realizing this concept

A bad outcome would be discovering a critical requirement for a vulnerability module that cannot be implemented within the Expo ecosystem, forcing a complex and time-consuming "ejection" to native code. Another bad outcome could be performance issues if the JavaScript-based simulations are too resource-intensive for a mobile device.
