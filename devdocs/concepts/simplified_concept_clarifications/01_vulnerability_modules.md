# 01: Vulnerability Modules (Prototype)

### What it is and why it matters

A "Vulnerability Module" is a self-contained, interactive component designed to demonstrate a single, specific security flaw. For the prototype, we will focus on a reduced set of the most common and illustrative vulnerabilities. This modular approach is critical to validate the core educational concept: breaking down complex security topics into focused, digestible lessons.

### How this concept helps the overall project

This concept forms the architectural backbone of the project, allowing for:
- **Focused Learning:** Users can concentrate on one core vulnerability at a time.
- **Architectural Validation:** It proves the modular design is viable for future expansion.
- **Rapid Prototyping:** By limiting the number of modules, we can build a functional proof-of-concept quickly.

### How this concept limits the overall project

For the prototype, this concept is intentionally limited in scope. It will not cover the full breadth of vulnerabilities planned for the final version. This means the initial prototype will not be a comprehensive educational tool, but rather a demonstration of the *method* of teaching. It also defers the challenge of demonstrating more complex, chained exploits.

### What kind of information this concept needs as input

Each module requires a clear definition of the vulnerability to be demonstrated. For the prototype, the scope is reduced to the following three essential modules:
1.  **Insecure Data Storage**
2.  **Hardcoded Secrets**
3.  **Insecure Communication**

Each also requires simplified educational content (Problem, Attack, Fix).

### What kind of process this concept should use

The development process for a prototype module remains the same but with a focus on speed and core functionality:
1.  **Define:** Scope the vulnerability to its most essential elements.
2.  **Implement:** Build the minimally viable React Native component.
3.  **Simulate:** Create a straightforward, simulated exploit.
4.  **Content:** Write concise "Problem," "Attack," and "Fix" sections.
5.  **Integrate:** Add the module to the main application dashboard.

### What kind of information this concept outputs or relays

The module outputs a functional, interactive user experience for one of the three core vulnerabilities. It relays a foundational understanding of the flaw, the exploit, and the mitigation, validating the educational model.

### Explain the good expected outcome of realizing this concept

The ideal outcome is a successful proof-of-concept. The prototype will have a small but representative set of modules that are engaging and educational. This validates the core architectural and educational assumptions and provides a solid foundation for securing funding or resources to build the full version.

### Explain the bad unwanted outcome of realizing this concept

A bad outcome would be oversimplifying the modules to the point that they are trivial or misrepresent the vulnerability. If the underlying architecture is not properly established (e.g., modules are tightly coupled), it will fail to support future expansion, defeating a key purpose of the prototype.
