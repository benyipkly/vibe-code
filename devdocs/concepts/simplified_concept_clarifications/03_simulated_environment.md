# 03: Simulated Environment (Prototype)

### What it is and why it matters

A "Simulated Environment" is a self-contained, sandboxed context where vulnerabilities are demonstrated safely. For the prototype, the simulations will be simplified to focus on the core exploit path. This is critical to ensure safety while allowing us to rapidly develop the interactive, hands-on component of the learning modules.

### How this concept helps the overall project

This concept is essential for validating the "hands-on" aspect of the project's philosophy. A simplified simulation allows us to:
-   **Prove Feasibility:** Demonstrate that we can build safe, interactive exploit demonstrations in React Native.
-   **Ensure Safety:** Maintain the core principle of not introducing any real risk to the user's device.
-   **Accelerate Development:** Avoid the complexity of building highly realistic simulations for the initial prototype.

### How this concept limits the overall project

The prototype's simulations will be less realistic than in the final version. They will not account for many real-world variables, edge cases, or environmental factors. This might give the user a slightly simplified view of how an exploit works, but it's a necessary trade-off for building a rapid and focused prototype.

### What kind of information this concept needs as input

To create a simplified simulation, the concept needs:
-   A clear definition of the single, primary attack vector to be simulated.
-   The core logic for the vulnerable component.
-   Simple, hardcoded mock data and endpoints.

### What kind of process this concept should use

The process for a simplified simulation is:
1.  **Isolate:** The interaction must be strictly contained within the app's components.
2.  **Mock:** Use simple, in-memory mock data. Avoid complex mock servers for the prototype; a function returning a hardcoded value is sufficient.
3.  **Validate:** The simulation logic must be reviewed to ensure it's self-contained.
4.  **Feedback:** The process must provide clear, immediate UI feedback to demonstrate the outcome of the simulated attack.

### What kind of information this concept outputs or relays

The concept outputs direct visual feedback within the UI that mimics the result of the core exploit. For example, it might simply display a hardcoded "password" on the screen after a button is pressed. It relays a tangible, though simplified, consequence of the vulnerability.

### Explain the good expected outcome of realizing this concept

The ideal outcome is an interactive and intuitive experience. The user can perform the simplified attack and immediately see the result, leading to a clear understanding of the basic exploit mechanism. This successfully validates the interactive learning model.

### Explain the bad unwanted outcome of realizing this concept

The worst-case outcome is a simulation that is so abstract or buggy that it confuses the user. Another bad outcome is accidentally creating a simulation that is not properly sandboxed, which would violate the project's core safety principle, even in a prototype.
