# 02: Educational Content (Prototype)

### What it is and why it matters

"Educational Content" is the explanatory text and code snippets for each module. In the prototype, this content will be concise and direct, focusing on the essential information needed to understand the vulnerability. This matters because it allows us to test the effectiveness of the "Problem, Attack, Fix" teaching model without investing heavily in comprehensive, long-form content.

### How this concept helps the overall project

This simplified approach helps the project by:
-   **Enabling Speed:** Allows for rapid content creation, accelerating the development of the prototype.
-   **Testing Core Assumptions:** Helps validate that the three-section structure is an effective teaching tool.
-   **Focusing on Essentials:** Forces a focus on the most critical information, which can inform the content strategy for the full version.

### How this concept limits the overall project

The primary limitation is the lack of depth. The prototype's content will not be a comprehensive resource. It will omit nuances, detailed examples of edge cases, and in-depth explanations of underlying technologies. This is a deliberate trade-off to achieve speed and validate the core concept.

### What kind of information this concept needs as input

The creation of simplified content requires:
-   **Technical Accuracy:** A correct understanding of the core vulnerability.
-   **Brevity:** The ability to distill the topic into key bullet points or short paragraphs.
-   **Essential Code:** The most straightforward "bad" vs. "good" code snippets.

### What kind of process this concept should use

The simplified content creation process is:
1.  **Structure:** Adhere strictly to the "Problem," "Attack," "Fix" sections.
2.  **Drafting:** Use bullet points and short, direct sentences. Avoid jargon.
3.  **Code Snippets:** Select the simplest, most illustrative code examples.
4.  **Review:** Perform a quick review for accuracy and clarity, not exhaustive detail.

### What kind of information this concept outputs or relays

This concept outputs concise, user-facing text and code within the prototype's UI. It relays the fundamental knowledge required to understand the core loop of each vulnerability module.

### Explain the good expected outcome of realizing this concept

The ideal outcome is that users of the prototype can quickly grasp the basics of each vulnerability. The content is clear, effective, and successfully proves that the "Problem, Attack, Fix" model works, justifying the creation of more detailed content in the future.

### Explain the bad unwanted outcome of realizing this concept

A bad outcome is content that is *so* simplified that it becomes inaccurate or misleading. If the core of the security lesson is lost in the pursuit of brevity, the prototype will fail to prove its educational value.
