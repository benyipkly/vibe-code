# Project Description

## What are we building?

The Vulnerable Android Playground (VAP) is an educational, interactive mobile application designed for Android to demonstrate common security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. Built with React Native and Expo, this app will serve as a safe, hands-on "capture the flag" style learning environment for developers, cybersecurity students, and penetration testers.

## What problem are we solving?

Instead of just describing threats, VAP will contain several modules, each dedicated to a specific vulnerability. Within each module, users can interact with a feature that is intentionally flawed. The app will guide the user on how the vulnerability works, how it can be exploited (in a simulated context), and most importantly, provide clear explanations and code snippets illustrating the best practices for mitigation. The goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical security knowledge and practical implementation, enabling developers to write more secure code from the start.

## What are the various scopes of this project?

The project will focus on the following key objectives:

- **Educate:** To provide a practical, hands-on educational tool for learning about Android and mobile application security.
- **Demonstrate:** To create interactive and easy-to-understand demonstrations of common vulnerabilities.
- **Remediate:** To offer clear, concise guidance and code examples on how to fix and prevent these security flaws.
- **Promote Security Awareness:** To encourage a "security-first" mindset among mobile developers.

## Who are the targeted users?

The targeted users for this project include:

- Developers
- Cybersecurity students
- Penetration testers
